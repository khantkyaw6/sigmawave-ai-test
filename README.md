# Fullstack Developer Interview Task

## Project Overview

Your task is to create a fullstack application using React.js with Tailwind CSS for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. The application should support user authentication (login and logout) using JWT, and it should allow CRUD operations on a user list with pagination handled on the back-end. Additionally, use Redux for state management on the front-end.

## Requirements

### Front-end
- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Redux & React-Redux**: For state management.

### Back-end
- **Node.js**: For the server.
- **Express.js**: For handling HTTP requests.
- **JWT**: For user authentication.

### Features
1. **Authentication**
   - Users should be able to register, login, and logout.
   - Use JWT for authentication.

2. **User Management**
   - Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete users.
   - Implement pagination for the user list. The pagination should be handled on the back-end.

3. **UI/UX**
   - Use Tailwind CSS to style the application.

4. **State Management**
   - Use Redux to manage the application's state, particularly for user authentication and user list management.
